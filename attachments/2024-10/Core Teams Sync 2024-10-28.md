# Overview
The Core Teams Sync meeting for Desktop and Mobile focused on several critical issues affecting project progress.

A significant delay in Mixpanel event tracking was identified, leading Jonathan to suggest testing with a new account while √çcaro volunteered to review the code for errors.

The mobile team has successfully completed 30% of the regression test suite, although they encountered new blockers; the desktop team faced minor issues related to logging improvements.

Discussions included simplifying the onboarding flow and username requirements, contemplating the use of public key alternatives.

Concerns about preserving protocol knowledge after Andrea's departure highlighted the need for updated documentation and better specs. Additionally, Igor announced an upcoming call with Jacek to discuss planning for Status Go's future, speculating on a possible rewrite in Nim.

The removal of ID verification code from the desktop was confirmed by Jonathan.

Proposal to enhance transparency through a migration of documentation from Notion to GitHub.
