Overview

The weekly sync for the status-go guild focused on several key areas, starting with a discussion led by Samuel on refining a draft of a zero policy document, emphasizing the need for clarity and actionable steps for implementation. The team decided to maintain the policy's focus on status-go for now and create a README file to clarify the policy process.

Igor reported progress on the Banix linter and highlighted potential integration of Sentry for crash reporting, while addressing concerns regarding data privacy.

The meeting also touched upon code coverage, with Igor tasked with finalizing integration and setting thresholds to manage flaky results.
