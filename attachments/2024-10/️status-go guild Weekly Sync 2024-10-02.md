# Overview
The weekly sync meeting of the status-go guild focused on several key areas, starting with a discussion on the meeting format and the potential use of Fireflies for transcription.

Team members provided updates on their ongoing projects, highlighting achievements such as integration of new proxy endpoints, backend work, and involvement in protocol discussions. Technical discussions addressed privacy policy changes and the GitHub PR workflow, while goals and accountability sections emphasised the importance of team member involvement in goal-setting and tracking work progress.

Strategies for enhancing collaboration and communication were debated, particularly regarding how to share goals with the wider team to foster engagement.
