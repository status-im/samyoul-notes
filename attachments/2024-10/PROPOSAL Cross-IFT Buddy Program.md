# Objective:

The Cross-IFT Buddy Program aims to foster collaboration and relationship-building across all IFT teams by pairing CCs from different parts of the organisation. This program provides a structured way for CCs to learn from each other and understand roles, responsibilities, and workflows outside of their regular teams.

# How It Works:

## Maintenance and Management:

- **Ownership**: Managed by People Partners from People Operations, who would coordinate pairings, monitor participation, and gather feedback.

## Logistics:

- **Opt-in Program**: CCs voluntarily join the program and are paired with a buddy from a different team. Opt-in assures motivation to engage fully with the program.
- **Time Allocation**: Participants meet for approximately **1 hour per week**, with each pairing lasting **2 months.**
- **Rotation**: Buddies rotate every 2 months per quarter, giving one month for additional matching, review and feedback loops. This will prevent diminishing returns and encourage exposure to different parts of the organisation. Afterward, buddies can rotate to new buddies or retire from the program, and will always have the option continue their relationship with their current buddy.
- **Buddy ‘Matchmaking’ Based on Skill Sets**: Match CCs based on complementary skill sets or declared interests, ensuring productive matching.
    - Consider [[#Process Inclusivity and Transparency]]

## Mechanics:

- **Casual Standups**: Each week, CCs conduct informal standups with each other, sharing what they've worked on and what they've learned. CCs are encouraged to relay this information to their own teams via their usual standup process, helping to promote cross-team knowledge exchange.
- **Cross-Departmental Workshops**: Following the buddy program, participants could share key insights through workshops, boosting knowledge transfer beyond the buddy pair.

## Growth:

- **Mentorship Opportunity**: Some buddy pairing may be designed explicitly for cultivating internal talent. CCs could also act as informal mentors during the buddy period, sharing personal career insights or guidance that could help their buddy in professional development. For this reason leads should consider their own participation in this program.

## Improvement:

- **Feedback Loops**: At the end of each buddy cycle, both CCs provide formal feedback to the program owner(s) on their experience, suggesting improvements for future cycles, ensuring continuous program refinement.

# Costs and Benefits:

## **Costs:**

1. **Potential Mismatches**: Not all CCs may match well with every other counterpart, resulting in possible inefficiency or friction if the pairing isn’t ideal.
2. **Managerial Overhead:** The program will require maintenance and orchestration which comes with time commitments from a responsible party.
3. **Distraction from Core Responsibilities**: Balancing the buddy program with existing workloads could divert focus from critical tasks.
4. **Misaligned Objectives**: If the objectives of the buddy pairs are not clearly communicated, there’s a risk of unclear expectations and unproductive meetings.

Also see [[#Staying On Track]]

## **Benefits:**

1. **Project Awareness**: Exposure to the work done in a different teams allows CCs to understand the challenges and accomplishments of other parts of the IFT organisation. CCs that share their learnings from their IFT buddies will allow their entire team an opportunity to realise new perspectives.
2. **Improved Social Bonds**: Regular interaction with new team members strengthens inter-team relationships, enhancing collaboration and fostering a more cohesive work culture.
3. **Career Development**: CCs gain exposure to new tools, workflows, and strategies, helping them diversify their skill set and explore potential career advancements.
4. **Innovation Catalyst**: By understanding the work of other teams, CCs may suggest process innovations or new features that hadn’t been considered before, benefiting the organisation’s overall output.
5. **Discovery of Synergies**: CCs may identify new opportunities for collaboration or process improvements that were previously unexplored, leading to potential innovation and efficiency gains across teams.
6. **Increased Flexibility in Project Management**: CCs with a broader understanding of other teams can help mitigate resource constraints or bottlenecks by jumping into different roles when needed.

## Staying On Track:

Ensuring participants make the most of the buddy program is key challenge and there are several ways to approach it.

### Clear Goals and Expectations:

1. **Establishing Clear Goals from the Start:** To ensure participants make the most of the program, we should require each buddy pair to set **clear, mutually agreed-upon goals** at the start of their relationship. These goals could focus on areas like learning specific skills, improving cross-team relationships, or gaining insight into different workflows. Having these goals will provide structure and purpose, making it easier for both parties to measure the success of their partnership and stay on track.
2. **Participants Defining What They Seek from the Program:** It’s also important that participants articulate what they want to achieve from the program. We can introduce a step where each CC, when joining the program, formally states what they are seeking—whether it’s mentorship, new perspectives, or deeper knowledge of another team's processes. This self-defined purpose will help ensure that participants are engaged with a clear focus on how they want to grow or contribute.
3. **Preference Selection for Buddy Matching:** Additionally, we could give participants the opportunity to provide their top 3 preferences for their buddy match, as well as a brief explanation of why they believe those matches would be beneficial. This gives participants more ownership of the process and allows them to align their personal goals with potential buddies who they feel could best support those aims. While preferences will be considered, final matches would still be balanced with program goals, such as cross-team collaboration and knowledge sharing. Also see [[#Process Inclusivity and Transparency]]

### Pairing Models

1. **Diverse Interaction Models:** Beyond simple knowledge sharing, we could offer multiple interaction models like project-based collaboration or joint problem-solving sessions, encouraging participants to apply what they learn in real scenarios. This could be especially helpful for understanding how different teams function and improving cross-departmental relationships. Example developers from different programs working on specific technical challenges to give mutually fresh eyes to their respective problems.
2. **Varied Pairing Models:** Depending on participants' goals, we can offer multiple engagement models, such as senior-junior mentorship, reciprocal learning, or simply sharing perspectives to deepen understanding of different teams. By offering this flexibility, participants can choose the type of relationship that best aligns with their goals, ensuring they extract real value from the program.

### Feedback

1. **Regular Feedback Loops:** Finally, we will include regular check-ins and feedback mechanisms, so if a pairing isn’t working or if goals need adjusting, we can respond quickly, keeping the program dynamic and effective.

### Trials, Self-screening and Fast Exits:

Unproductive pairings are a common issue in buddy programs, and it’s crucial to prevent them from dragging on without resolution. I like the idea of incorporating an optional pre-buddy ****phase to test the waters before committing to a full cycle.

1. **Pre-Buddy Trial Phase:** For pairs who haven’t interacted or have had limited interaction, we could introduce a short, informal "trial" period, approximately 1-2 weeks. During this time, the pair could engage in a few light, unstructured conversations or shadow each other’s work to assess compatibility. Since this is an informal and private phase, both participants would feel more comfortable deciding if the relationship is productive without external pressure.
2. **Private and Discreet Assessment:** If either participant feels the pairing isn’t working during the pre-phase, they can mutually agree to end the pairing without it being made public. This way, there’s no stigma or judgement around the cancellation, and the participants can move on to a new match.
3. **Fast Exit Mechanism:** Should the pairing not work out, the program could include a quick and easy re-matching process, ensuring no time is lost for either party. The key is to prevent unproductive pairings from dragging on and to foster a culture where it’s okay to acknowledge when things aren’t working.

By focusing on **goal-setting** at the start and allowing CCs to communicate what they want to achieve, we can help ensure that participants are motivated and get the most out of their buddy relationships, while also fostering a stronger, more transparent matching process.

## How It Differs from Onboarding Buddies:

- **Purpose**: Onboarding buddies help new hires integrate, while Cross IFT buddies expose established CCs to different teams and functions.
- **Duration**: Onboarding buddies last a few weeks, whereas Cross IFT buddies last 3-4 months, allowing deeper relationships and better knowledge sharing.
- **Implementation**: Onboarding Buddies tend to be matched within the local cluster of teams, Cross IFT Buddies a designed to weave all teams in the IFT closer together. In contrast to onboarding, both participating CCs will be experienced in their respective teams, which allows for a meeting of peers. Further the implementation is designed such that CCs who may never interact otherwise, can, with the explicit intent to understand each other’s roles and teams.

# Next Steps:

- **Pilot Phase**: Run a pilot for 3 months with volunteer participants, collecting feedback.
- **Evaluation and Scale**: Adjust based on pilot feedback and scale for broader participation.
