- **🖥️🔍 Desktop QA Team**: Flexibility in when expert input is required and reducing formalities around user stories.
- **🌐👛 Wallet Teams**: Flexibility in feature flows and the documentation process.

### Improved Documentation and Communication

- **📄 Docs Team**: Concerned about documentation gaps, tracking changes, and automation in documentation processes.
- **🖥️🔍 Desktop QA Team**: Wants entry points for features in the development lifecycle, especially tracking parity across platforms.
- **🌐🤘 Core Teams**: Ensure technical specs are evolving.

- **📱👛 Mobile Wallet Team**: Moving documentation to GitHub for better tracking and closing issues.

### Decision Recording

- **📄 Docs Team**: Formalising the process of documenting features and highlighting feature changes.
- **🖥️🔍 Desktop QA Team**: Needs better visibility into development processes and decision tracking.

### Feedback and Iteration

- **🎨 Design Team**: Features should be developed simultaneously across platforms to streamline feedback and iteration.
- **📄 Docs Team**: Focus on automating alerts when a feature reaches certain stages.
- **🖥️🔍 Desktop QA Team**: Ideation output and inputs from multiple teams should be visible and accessible.
- **🌐🤘 Core Teams**: Emphasise iterative development with feedback loops and continuous improvement of technical specs.
- **🖥️👛 Desktop Wallet Team**: Ensure feedback stages feed into ideation and roadmap planning.

### Cross-Team Visibility and Coordination

- **🖥️🔍 Desktop QA Team**: Visibility into upcoming features and reconciling different development styles.
- **🌐🤘 Core Teams**: Input from different teams at various stages of the process.
- **📱🤘 Mobile Core Team**: Involvement of multiple "3 Amigos" may be necessary for larger epics and feature ideas from multiple sources.

### Tools and Workspaces

- **📄 Docs Team**: Shared workspaces (e.g., Crews) and process automation.
