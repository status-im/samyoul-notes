# Overview
The Core Teams Sync (Desktop + Mobile) meeting focused on critical aspects affecting both platforms, beginning with a release coordination update highlighting the need for version compatibility amongst releases 229, 230, and 231, with the mobile team targeting an end-of-October release. The session addressed improvements in the bug reporting process, emphasizing the challenges of user privacy when collecting logged information, and explored the potential use of Sentry or Google Crash Reporting. The group discussed the establishment of a central repository for legal documents, stressing the importance of versioning and handling diverging features across platforms, while also raising concerns regarding the accuracy of app store information and the need for comprehensive privacy policies. Additionally, issues with community description synchronization were identified, particularly regarding the ‚Äòlast opened at‚Äô property and its bandwidth implications. A discussion on state management revealed the misuse of Waku, prompting consideration of alternative solutions and a plan for implementing necessary changes. Action items were assigned to various members for follow-up on compatibility checks, error logging integration, privacy policy inquiries, synchronization removal, and community description contributions.
