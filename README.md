## Pulls

- [Removing torrent from mobile build #5257](https://github.com/status-im/status-go/pull/5257) - `commits`
  - Readied this PR for review, and requested reviews
  - Gave proper attribution and full context
  - Replaced entirely `LogStdout` with default `logger`
  - Replaced `fmt.Sprintf` usage from `zap.logger` calls
  - Explicitly cast `ManagerSuite.torrentManager`
    - Instead of using the `TorrentContract` interface I've set the field to expicitly declare as `*TorrentManager`. This removes all the random type casting used in the tests. I also removed all the usages of `buildTorrentConfig()` as we build the test suite with the torrent config now.
  - Renamed **ManagerMobile to **ManagerNop
  - Renamed Torrent to Archive
    - I've renamed `TorrentManager` to `ArchiveManager`, `ArchiveManager` to `ArchiveFileManager`, `TorrentContract` to `ArchiveService`, `ArchiveContract` to `ArchiveFileService`. I've also renamed all init functions and struct fields to the appropriate archive-centric naming.
  - Renamed archive files to archive_file
  - Renamed torrent files to archive
  - Fixed failing tests
  - Gave a defence of my approach and acknowledgment of its failings

## Pulls

- [Removing torrent from mobile build #5257](https://github.com/status-im/status-go/pull/5257) - `commits`, `scoping`
  - Removed TorrentManager from `handleImportedMessages`
  - Removed TorrentManager from `checkIfIMemberOfCommunity`
  - Moved archive related funcs into `ArchiveManager`
    - To be honest once I started this work I quickly realised how pointless it is as archiving functionality and torrent seeding functionality are really entwined. So I'm keeping the code I've done, but it is a bit pointless without spending a lot of time untangling torrenting and archiving. I'm just going to make an interface for all the functions that are used publicly from `TorrentManager`. I think that this will be the fast way to move on from this issue. I don't like this work anymore, there is a lot of work to do elsewhere and torrent is a rabbit hole filled with canned worms.
  - Created `TorrentContract` and `ArchiveContract` interfaces
  - Created nil structs for Mobile use (or close to nil as possible)
  - Mapped all 2nd level `TorrentManager` usage
