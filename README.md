## Feature Upvote
- Created a list of priorities and timeline https://discuss.status.app/t/we-need-to-talk-about-feature-upvote/4823/3
- I've asked Jo to change the Feature Upvote subscription model to monthly and to export the data from our account.
- Before I can reactivate our Feature Request functionality it seem that I need to be a moderator of the Discourse forum see [Status Discourse moderators](https://discuss.status.app/g/moderators)
	- I've reached out to Jakub, Jen and Terry to see if they can assign me to the Moderator group.
- I've asked Sid about setting Feature Upvote's logins with BitWarden

- I've written the detailed Policy Review and Archival Process:
	- https://www.notion.so/DRAFT-Policy-Zero-Foundational-Guidelines-for-Policy-Management-in-status-go-1368f96fb65c80a5b523ee9cfddf0699?pvs=4#1388f96fb65c80039ea6fd91ac896632
- Moved the `DRAFT Policy Zero: Foundational Guidelines for Policy Management in status-go` document into the status-go notion section.
