	- Summary
		- In this meeting, the team discussed the status of wallet security testing. They acknowledged that the wallet was released without a formal audit, unlike previous releases, and decided to conduct internal pentesting before seeking external certification. They considered using a familiar security firm, Least Authority, for an external audit of a specific wallet version. The team addressed concerns about which code version to test and agreed to finalize a timeline. Next steps include reaching out to the firm for quotes and scheduling further meetings to discuss progress
