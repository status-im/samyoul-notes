  - Related to this PR there seems to be some discrepancy between what Code Climate judges as having test coverage and what IntelliJ IDEA reports.
  - From the case of this PR it seems that Code Climate is less accurate and reports that some statements are not covered when they are.

## Pulls

- [Removing torrent from mobile build #5257](https://github.com/status-im/status-go/pull/5257) - `commits`, `scoping`
  - Removed TorrentManager from `handleImportedMessages`
  - Removed TorrentManager from `checkIfIMemberOfCommunity`
  - Moved archive related funcs into `ArchiveManager`
    - To be honest once I started this work I quickly realised how pointless it is as archiving functionality and torrent seeding functionality are really entwined. So I'm keeping the code I've done, but it is a bit pointless without spending a lot of time untangling torrenting and archiving. I'm just going to make an interface for all the functions that are used publicly from `TorrentManager`. I think that this will be the fast way to move on from this issue. I don't like this work anymore, there is a lot of work to do elsewhere and torrent is a rabbit hole filled with canned worms.
  - Created `TorrentContract` and `ArchiveContract` interfaces
  - Created nil structs for Mobile use (or close to nil as possible)
  - Mapped all 2nd level `TorrentManager` usage

    - Follow on from [`TorrentManager` API Usage](https://github.com/status-im/status-go/pull/5257#issuecomment-2142881649)
